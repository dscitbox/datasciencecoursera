This is the readme file for the run_analysis.R file, required for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" project assignment

To run, the program expects the Samsung data in a subdirectory of the directory where the program is located
(e.g. ./UCI_HAR Dataset/...)
The program requires the data.table and plyr libraries to be installed.
